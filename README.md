NOTES:
1) VISUALIZING ALL SKILLS RANKED BY ALL INCLUDED COUNTRIES WOULD BE INFORMATION OVERLOAD
2) DECIDED TO FOCUS ON UNITED STATES ONLY
3) FOR 2016, THERE WERE ONLY 10 RANKED DATA SKILLS
4) TO STANDARDIZE THE VISUALIZATIONS, OPTED TO RESTRICT RANKED SKILLS TO THE TOP 10
5) DECIDED TO CREATE 3 HORIZONTAL BAR CHARTS, ONE FOR EACH YEAR
6) SKILLS WOULD BE EASIER TO READ IF DISPLAYED ON THE Y-AXIS
7) PACKAGING THE BAR CHARTS AS THREE ROW / ONE COLUMN SUBPLOT WOULD ALLOW EASY COMPARISON BETWEEN YEARS
