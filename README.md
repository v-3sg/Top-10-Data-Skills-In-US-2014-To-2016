# Top-10-Data-Skills-In-US-2014-To-2016
Bar chart visualization of portion of LinkedIn dataset

The purpose of this exercise was to see how I would re-do an existing data visualization listed on the Make Over Monday website (see URLs below). I selected a dataset that was visualized with Tableau and realized I'd it would be too much information (not to mention too difficult with my limited skillset) to try to make something comparable in Python. I came up with a set of three subplotted bar charts focusing on the top 10 data skills in the United States between 2014 and 2016. Some things I noticed:
1) Cloud and Distributed Computing was ranked number one for all three years.
2) Statistical Analysis and Data Mining was ranked number two for all three years.
3) Foreign Language Translation, which was number six in 2014, completely dropped out of the top 10 for 2015 and 2016.
4) Perl/Python/Ruby was number 10 in 2014 and dropped out of the top 10 for 2015 and 2016.

NOTES:
1) VISUALIZING ALL SKILLS RANKED BY ALL INCLUDED COUNTRIES WOULD BE INFORMATION OVERLOAD
2) DECIDED TO FOCUS ON UNITED STATES ONLY
3) FOR 2016, THERE WERE ONLY 10 RANKED DATA SKILLS
4) TO STANDARDIZE THE VISUALIZATIONS, OPTED TO RESTRICT RANKED SKILLS TO THE TOP 10
5) DECIDED TO CREATE 3 HORIZONTAL BAR CHARTS, ONE FOR EACH YEAR
6) SKILLS WOULD BE EASIER TO READ IF DISPLAYED ON THE Y-AXIS
7) PACKAGING THE BAR CHARTS AS THREE ROW / ONE COLUMN SUBPLOT WOULD ALLOW EASY COMPARISON BETWEEN YEARS
